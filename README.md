Application-game "Guess the number" using the Tkinter library, written in the Python programming language.
The application guesses a number in a given range and asks the user to guess it.
If the entered number is less than the given one,
then the program prompts that the hidden number is greater, and vice versa.
When guessing the number, the program displays congratulations on the number of attempts made.
