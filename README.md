Application-game "Guess the number" using the Tkinter library, written in the Python programming language.
The application guesses a number in the specified range and asks the user to guess it (10 attempts are given for this).
If the entered number is less than the given one,
then the program prompts that the number is greater, and vice versa.
When guessing the number, the program displays congratulations on the number of attempts made. If you can't guess, then you can try your luck again.
